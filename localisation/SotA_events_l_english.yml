There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in preparation for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, been ordered to grind the grains into flour. The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600 km (360 mi). It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet.

 diadochiwars.1.t:0 "Partition of Babylon"
 diadochiwars.1.d:0 "The Partition of Babylon was the first of the conferences and ensuing agreements that divided the territories of Alexander the Great. It was held at Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander's death at the age of 32 had left an empire that stretched from Greece all the way to India. \nThe issue of succession resulted from the claims of the various supporters of Philip Arrhidaeus (Alexander's half-brother), and the as-of-then unborn child of Alexander and Roxana, among others. Alexander's death was the catalyst for the disagreements that ensued between his former generals resulting in a succession crisis. \nTwo main factions formed after the death of Alexander. The first of these was led by Meleager, who supported the candidacy of Alexander's half-brother, Arrhidaeus. \nThe second was led by Perdiccas, the leading cavalry commander, who believed it would be best to wait until the birth of Alexander's unborn child, by Roxana. Both parties agreed to a compromise, wherein Arrhidaeus would become king as Philip III and rule jointly with Roxana's child, providing it was a male heir. Perdiccas was designated as regent of the empire, with Meleager acting as his lieutenant. However, soon after, Perdiccas had Meleager and the other leaders who had opposed him murdered, and he assumed full control. \nThe territories of the empire became satrapies divided between the senior officers of the Macedonian army and some local governors and rulers. The partition began the series of conflicts that comprise the Wars of the Diadochi.\n\nThe news of Alexander's death inspired a revolt in Greece, known as the Lamian War. Athens and other cities formed a coalition and besieged Antipater in the fortress of Lamia. \n\nMeanwhile Perdiccas, who was already betrothed to the daughter of Antipater, attempted to marry Alexander's sister, princess of Epirus and widow Cleopatra, a marriage which would have given him claim to the Macedonian throne. In 322 BC, Antipater, Craterus and Antigonus all formed a coalition against Perdiccas's growing power. In late 322 or early 321 BC, Ptolemy stole Alexander's body on its way to Macedonia and then joined the coalition."
