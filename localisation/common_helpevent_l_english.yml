 help_event.2.t:0 "Population System - Explanation"
 help_event.2.d:0 "§ODevelopment§! has been replaced by a Population system which splits development into 3 Population Classes.\n§OUpper Class§! - Which provides % modifiers, the most tax, but no manpower or land FL.\n§OCommoners§! - Which provides better economic modifiers than tribal, but half as much manpower.\n§OTribal§! - Which provides a lot of manpower, but lower economic benifit. Sometimes also called rural or lower class.\nThese will increase randomly based on current §OPopulation§! compared to §OPopulation Capacity§!, which can be seen by hovering over the province modifier in any province.\n§OPopulation Capacity§! is mostly gained through Buildings and Trade Power, but §OProvince Size§! (visible in the province modifier) also plays a major role.\n§OPopulation§! can §Gpromote§! from lower classes if growth rate is §Gpositive§!, or §Rdemote§! and §Rmigrate away§! if growth rate is §Rnegative§!.\n\nMore specific information can be found in provinces, and the extra options within this event."

 help_event.3.t:0 "Sieges Reworked - Explanation"
 help_event.3.d:0 "Winning a siege of an enemy's city will fire an event in order to decide what to to. Availabilty of options depends on the situation: a simple regiment of 1.000 soldiers won't be enough to sack a big city! \nThere is now an §Mefficiency ratio§!: Army size £icon_manpower£, "Ferocity" or viciousness of the attackers £mil£ (base value is 5), and province's population ¤1 in thousands. Value capped at 100%. \nAs an example, if you are besieging a city of 15 development, to achieve 100% efficiency you'd need (X regiments) * 5 (ferocity) = 15*10 -> 30 thousand soldiers. \nEvery option below needs military power, obtains a sizable amount of §Oloot money§! (with the possibility of destroying buildings) and causes a given amount of §Rdevastation§! and §gpopulation lost§! or §Benslaved§!. \nThe maximum amount of population lost will be those over 60%/40%/20% minimum of tribals, commoners and upper population respectively. With the population to be enslaved, substracting all those who resist or can't be used, it's shared between §g%lost§! and §B%enslaved§!  \nOptions are as follows: \n - Ask Tribute:     5£mil£  §O20%§! / §R  5%§! / §g-§!   \n - Sack the city:   20£mil£  §O60%§! / §R 30%§! / §g-%§!   \n - Enslave (soft):  20£mil£  §O 5%§! / §R 10%§! / §g60%§!-§B40%§!   \n - Enslave (hard):  20£mil£  §O10%§! / §R 25%§! / §g20%§!-§B80%§!   \n - Destroy the city:  60£mil£ §O40%§! / §R 60%§! / §g60%§!-§B40%§!   \n - Delenda Est X:   100£mil£  §O100%§! / §R100%§! / §g80%§!-§B20%§!   \n - Leave them be: nothing   \n In the future there will be an option to §GLiberate§! their population if these are of your core, culture or other conditions."

 help_event.6.t:0 "The Romans"
 help_event.6.d:0 "The Romans had conquered vast stretches of land from Brittania to Mesopotamia and everywhere inbetween. Some of these areas conformed and 'romanized', other areas continued revolting til they were slaughtered.

Additionally, there is a §ODecision§! to enable releasing nations as §BSocii§! if desired. Only nations that start with their §OCapital§! in the eligible region can be released as a §BSocii§!, however.\n\n§BSocii§! as a whole will revolt if their §RDissatisfaction§! gets too high. There is no way to lower it. It will go up with most actions associated with §BSocii§!. Making them, calling them to war, a §BSocii§! revolting, and §BSocii§! existing with §OLiberty Desire§!.\nUpon §RDissatisfaction§! reaching 1,000, the §BSocii§! will unify into 1 nation and declare war on you. Winning the war will result in full core annexation.\n\n§BSocii§! will be disabled as a mechanic upon winning the §OSocial War§!, or if you have no §BSocii§! at any point.

 help_event.62.t:0 "Romanization"
 help_event.62.d:0 "\n§BRomanization§!, as it was called, is a mechanic within IU that will happen over time in provinces owned by countries of §OLatin Culture§!. Only certain cultures can be assimilated, and the shown map is a rough guide for what cultures will look like after assimilation. This can change throughout a run depending on events, however.\n\n§BRomanization§! requires §OParliament Issues§! to be passed for it to function, and will spread depending on however much the issue passed allows.There are 4 stages of these parliament issues, listed below.\n§OAllow Latin Romanization§!: Will allow all Italic group and Etruscans to assimilate into Latin culture.\n§OAllow All Italian Romanization§!: Will allow all provinces in Italy to Romanize.\n§OAllow Syncreticized Romanization§!: Will allow any province to Romanize if the local religion is syncreticized.\n§OAllow All Romanization§!: Will allow any province to Romanize.\nAdditionally, any §BRomanization§! requires §O15 Government Organization§!, positive §OStability§!, and for the province to have under §R3§! unrest and be in a state.\n\nMany modifiers will increase §GRomanization Speed§!, such as higher §OStability§!, §OGovernment Organization§!, being §OSyncreticized§! or the §OState Religion§!, having §OGovernment§!, §OCultural§!, §OAcademic§!, or §ORoad§! buildings, having more §OUpper Class§! and §OCommoner pops§!, being §OProsperous§!, and having a §OCOT§!.\nThere are only a few things that §Rdecrease Romanization§!, being §RLocal Autonomy§!, and §RTribal Population§!."

 help_event.63.d:0 "The §BRoman Kingdom§! was established upon the founding of Rome, and lasted until its last king was deposed in 509 BC.

There are 2 more kings until the §BRoman Kingdom§! is deposed as it was historically. §OServius Tullius§!, son in law of §!Tarquinius Priscus§!. And the last king, §OTarquinius Superbus§!, most probably grandson of §OTarquinius Priscus§!.\n\nThe §BRoman Kingdom§! can be deposed in 3 ways in varying cost and consequences.\nThe Historical way has almost §Gno consequences§!, and involves waiting for the §RDisaster§! once you have §OTarquinius Superbus§!.\nThe 2nd way, is an event once you get §OServius Tullius§!, which has some §Rcosts§! and will §Ranger the Etruscans§!.\nThe 3rd way, is to let §RDemocratic Rebels§! win. This has §Rmany costs§! and will also §Ranger the Etruscans§!. You are not meant to stay as the Kingdom permanently, and it is recommended to wait for the historical route."
